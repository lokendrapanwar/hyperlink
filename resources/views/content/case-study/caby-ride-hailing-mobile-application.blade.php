<p class="desc text-center mb-0">What if you are in a hurry and you cannot find even a single auto or taxi that can take you to your desired location so always end up being late right? Guess what, now you won't be late for any of your meetings or come back home safe from the late-night party on your own as well as there is always a ride waiting for you to drop you at your desired location with a few taps on the mobile screen. Caby is a ride-hailing mobile application where you can register yourself as a rider and book yourself a ride by submitting a ride request. The request will be sent automatically to a Caby registered driver near you, alerting the driver to your location. The accepting Caby driver will then come and pick you up and drive you to your requested destination. Say goodbye to overcrowded bus rides with the Caby mobile application.</p>

<p class="desc mb-0">The client wanted a ride-hailing mobile application where users can book rides for themselves as well as for their loved ones as well. The main requirement was to provide an easy-to-use UI so that anyone can book the ride even without any age barrier or much technical knowledge. The client wanted to set the algorithms that can automatically figure out the navigational ride route for the driver, calculate the ride distance and ride fare, and transfer the ride payment to the driver from users' selected payment methods like card, wallet or cash.</p>

<p class="desc mb-0">We all know there are so many other ride-hailing mobile applications out there but Caby wanted to rule the market through its easy to use user interface so that users can book their ride and enjoy it effortlessly.<br><br>So, our aim for developing the mobile application was to resolve all the issues that users tend to face using different frameworks and approaches. To begin with, we analyzed the concept hypothetically and created a file with the complete details covering all these points, diagrams, scenarios, problems, flow charts, and SRS for the entire workflow and planned the App development process. After finalizing the document, In the third phase, based on the client's requirements and our findings we defined Mobile App architectures for Caby App. After that Our Mobile app designers started working on the prepared mobile app wire-frames and Application design. After getting approval on the final app design, our app developers move ahead with the development phase. We created the prototype for the Caby app with all the native and data, After the client's review and confirmation of the prototype. The Mobile app developers started their development process by choosing the best-fit technology for android, iOS and the admin panel. We integrated API's in the Caby app and completed the whole app data flow.<br><br>We chose native technology swift for iOS development and Kotlin for android development and used JSON-based rest API development with Node and Laravel Framework. Hyperlink Infosystem developers used Angular 9 to create an admin panel for basic tasks such as managing rides, user details rating and reviews etc. We used web3 for calling the smart contracts with the help of solidity. Our app developers had used Magic SDK for passwordless authentication providing secure login. Any existing ride-hailing mobile apps usually face the problem of poor user experience. Our app developers eliminated that with the help of a Matic network to deliver an exceptional user experience.<br><br>From requirement gathering to deployment, the Caby app development journey was full of challenges. However, our dedication and teamwork led us to deliver the solution successfully, as well as within the prescribed timeline & budget. After the development phase, our QA team tested the mobile application before finally delivering it to the client.</p>

<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>1. User friendly and easy to use UI</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-3">The primary concern of the ride-hailing mobile application is to provide the simplest user interface. So, our mobile app developer created many custom views and created a UI which looks modern at the same time it should be simple and easy to use.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>2. Real-time ride tracking</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-3">Another application requirement is that Drivers / Customers should be able to easily track their ride in real-time from ride navigation. Our developers resolved the challenge to integrate google maps and used route APIS to draw ride routes.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>3. Book and share rides for other users</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-3">In Caby customers can book and share the ride or other customers this was a challenging part of the Caby app as the system needs to manage a lot of data and at the same time the system needs to notify the user for whom the ride is booked.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>4. Multiple payment gateways</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-0">The client wanted to integrate multiple payment gateways such as digital wallets, cards and so on. The Hyperlink Infosystem developers integrated M Pesa payment gateway for instant payment from sim card.</p>
