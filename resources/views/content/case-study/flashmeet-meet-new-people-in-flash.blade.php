<p class="desc mb-0">Various social networking mobile applications allow users to connect with the users but Flashmeet is unique in providing the users to connect with nearby users based on their check-in locations.<br><br>So, our aim for developing the mobile application was to provide an enhanced user experience providing them with a platform to connect through their GPS navigation. To begin with, we analyzed the concept hypothetically and created a file with the complete details covering all these points, diagrams, scenarios, problems, flow charts, and SRS for the entire workflow and planned the App development process. After finalizing the document, In the third phase, based on the client's requirements and our findings, we defined Mobile App architectures for Flashmeet Mobile App. After that, Our Mobile app designers started working on the prepared mobile app wire-frames and Application design. After getting approval on the final app design, our app developers move ahead with the development phase. We created the Flashmeet app prototype with all the native data after the client's review and confirmation of the prototype. The Mobile app developers started their development process by choosing the best-fit technology for android, iOS, and the admin panel. Then, we integrated the API in the Flashmeet mobile app and completed the whole app data flow.<br><br>Hyperlink Infosystem app developers used the best fit native technology swift for iOS development and Kotlin for android development and used JSON-based rest API development with Laravel and Codeigniter Framework. We used web3 for calling the smart contracts with the help of solidity. Our app developers had used Magic SDK for passwordless authentication providing secure login. Any existing social networking mobile apps can not provide accurate GPS navigation. Our app developers eliminated that to deliver an exceptional flawless user experience.<br><br>The Flashmeet app development journey was full of challenges, from requirement gathering to deployment. However, our dedication and teamwork led us to deliver the solution successfully, as well as within the prescribed timeline & budget. After the development phase, our QA team tested the mobile application before finally delivering it to the client.</p>

<p class="desc mb-0">The primary concern of the Flashmeet mobile application is an auto popup for the nearby location functionality. It was a challenge for us to task as we have to track the live location of the user and also gather the information about the listed business in nearby locations. We achieved that through deep analysis and created our own algorithm to crack that automatic pop-up. Our App Developers worked tirelessly to work on this functionality and developed a solution that can handle the auto popup location functionality perfectly.</p>
