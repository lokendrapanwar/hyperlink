<p class="desc text-center mb-0">Human safety has always been a topic of discussion all around the globe. We do have countries safer than the others but none of them is safe and secure with a 100% law enforcement success rate. Along with that, it is not an easy task to find and get help whenever they want. Considering all these points DigiEyez is a step forward for women's safety.<br><br>DigiEyez is a mobile application that allows users to register themselves and reach out for help whenever they need it. The mobile app users can generate alerts mentioning their state of emergency and get help as soon as possible. Users can even track their action status based on their alerts.</p>

<p class="desc mb-0">The client wanted a mobile application where people around the USA and Africa can generate alerts for emergencies and get help whenever they need it. The main requirement of the mobile application was to provide an easy-to-use UI so that anyone in trouble can send the alerts with minimum actions. The client wanted to set the algorithms that can automatically locate the accurate location of the users and send the help immediately. At the same time, users can even view the status of their alerts for the action taken by the command center. The users can also purchase the security appliances directly to keep their premises, and surrounding safe and secure from any hazardous activities.</p>

<h2 class="main-title mb-3 mt-60 services-title cs-project-title c-black">Project Approach &amp; Results</h2>
<p class="desc mb-0">We all know even with top-notch law and enforcement, a number of crimes happen all around the USA and Africa. So, we needed a mobile application that can at least take quick actions based on user requirements. As the users interact with the mobile application in case of emergencies, we had a huge responsibility to provide an easy-to-use user interface so that any users can generate their requests even in a moment of panic.
<br><br>So, our aim for developing the mobile application was to minimize the chances of criminal activities and provide help as soon as possible for the USA and Africa-based individuals using different frameworks and approaches. To begin with, we analyzed the concept hypothetically and created a file with the complete details covering all these points, diagrams, scenarios, problems, flow charts, and SRS for the entire workflow and planned the App development process. After finalizing the document, In the third phase, based on the client's requirements and our findings, we defined Mobile App architectures for DigiEyez App. After that, Our Mobile app designers started working on the prepared mobile app wire-frames and Application design. After getting approval on the final app design, our app developers move ahead with the development phase. We created the prototype for the DigiEyez app with all the native data, After the client's review and confirmation of the prototype. The Mobile app developers started their development process by choosing the best-fit technology for android, iOS, and the admin panel. We integrated APIs in the DigiEyez app and completed the whole app data flow.
<br><br>We chose native technology swift for iOS development and Kotlin for android development and used JSON-based rest API Development with Node and Express Framework. Hyperlink Infosystem developers used Angular 9 to create an admin panel for basic tasks such as managing user details, services, order details, etc. We have used web3 for calling smart contracts with the help of solidity. Our app developers had used Magic SDK for passwordless authentication providing secure login. As the main purpose of the mobile application is to provide a smooth service experience to the users in emergency situations, our app developers took the help of the Matic network to deliver an exceptional user experience.
<br><br>From requirement gathering to deployment, the DigiEyez app development journey was full of challenges. However, our dedication and teamwork led us to deliver the solution successfully, as well as within the prescribed timeline & budget. After the development phase, our QA team tested the mobile application before finally delivering it to the client.

<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>1. Quick to Use the User Interface</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-4">The primary concern of the DigiEyeZ mobile application is to provide a quick-to-use user interface. So, our mobile app developer created many custom views and created a UI that any user can access and reach the command center with minimum clicks.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>2. Request Action Tracking</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-4">Another application requirement is that users should be able to easily track the request action generated by the command center, at the same time providing accurate location of the users to the command center in real-time. Our developers resolved the challenge to integrate google maps and used route APIS to draw service routes.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>3. Audio/Video Calling Functionality</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-4">In the DigiEyez mobile application, users can call the nearby command center through a single click without dialing any numbers. This was a challenging part of the DigiEyez mobile app as the system needs to gather the user details and track the accurate location as soon as the user generates the request and at the same time, the nearby command center should be able to get the request based on the user's location with accurate details. Along with that, the users should be able to get the call even if the mobile app is not open or active in the background. Our app developers handled this specific client request by implementing customized algorithms.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>4. Find Nearby Command Center</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-0">The client wanted to send the generated request to the nearby command center based on user location and find an alternative if the nearby command center is unavailable to accept the request. The Hyperlink Infosystem developers developed the system that matches the user location with the nearby command center and in case of unavailability, the request will be forwarded to the other nearby command center.</p>
