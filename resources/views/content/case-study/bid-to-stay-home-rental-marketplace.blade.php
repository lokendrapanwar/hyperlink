<p class="desc text-center mb-0">The other half of the people struggle to find the perfect place to rent for their stay, which they can say is their perfect home even for the shortest stay. The other half is struggling to get the perfect guest for their place, which they have put on the rent. You might say that various mobile applications are available out there that can help users find their perfect place for rent. But how many of them allow users to stay just for a few days rather than months? Probably none, right? Bid to Stay is a mobile home marketplace application that allows users to rent a place for selective days allowing users to bid on their favorite places. On the other hand, the users can also put their place on rent providing all the necessary details about their property. Bid to Stay provides a home away from home.</p>

<p class="desc mb-0">The client wanted a home rental marketplace mobile application where users can bid on the properties they want to stay at after providing basic details such as check-in, check-out dates, and the number of guests for themselves as well as for their loved ones as well. The main requirement was to provide a two-way app where, as a host, you can add your property details with price discounts and the availability of property to rent out. As the customer, you can view properties based on date and place requirements and book properties.<br><br>The client wanted to set the algorithms that allow booking the properties from the users' end as well as from the host end. The client also wanted to provide the bidding functionality along with directly renting out the property. The client wanted to provide the auto-accept functionality along with a manual one where the host can manage the bidding by accepting and rejecting the one. The bid winning day for the auto-accept functionality will be the Wednesdays of the month based on the booking date. Users can also rebid with the higher price in the case of outbidding.</p>

<p class="desc mb-0">
Various mobile applications allow users to rent out the properties, but Bid to Stay has unique requirements to provide a platform where users can rent the properties for several days based on bidding functionality.
<br><br>So, our aim for developing the mobile application was to resolve all the issues that users tend to face using different frameworks and approaches. To begin with, we analyzed the concept hypothetically and created a file with the complete details covering all these points, diagrams, scenarios, problems, flow charts, and SRS for the entire workflow and planned the App development process. After finalizing the document, In the third phase, based on the client's requirements and our findings, we defined Mobile App architectures for Bid To Stay Mobile App. After that, Our Mobile app designers started working on the prepared mobile app wire-frames and Application design. After getting approval on the final app design, our app developers move ahead with the development phase. We created the Bid To Stay app prototype with all the native data after the client's review and confirmation of the prototype. The Mobile app developers started their development process by choosing the best-fit technology for android, iOS, and the admin panel. Then, we integrated API in the Bid To Stay mobile app and completed the whole app data flow.
<br><br>We chose native technology swift for iOS development and Kotlin for android development and used JSON-based rest API development with Node and Codeigniter Framework. Hyperlink Infosystem app developers used the best fit technology to create an admin panel for basic tasks such as managing properties, bidding details, user details, rating, and reviews, etc. We used web3 for calling the smart contracts with the help of solidity. Our app developers had used Magic SDK for passwordless authentication providing secure login. Any existing Home Rental mobile apps usually face the problem of poor user experience. Our app developers eliminated that with the help of a Matic network to deliver an exceptional user experience.
<br><br>The Bid to Stay app development journey was full of challenges, from requirement gathering to deployment. However, our dedication and teamwork led us to deliver the solution successfully, as well as within the prescribed timeline & budget. After the development phase, our QA team tested the mobile application before finally delivering it to the client.

<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>1. Auto Bidding Functionality Implementation</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-4">The primary concern of theBid To Stay mobile application is auto-bidding functionality. It was a challenge for us to task the last 4 possible Wednesdays from the booking date and autocomplete the bid on the very first Wednesday. For this, we had to check many scenarios as there are possible Wednesdays or not; another user has not booked property within the same time as well. Our App Developers worked tirelessly to work on this functionality and developed a solution that can handle the auto bid functionality perfectly.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>2. Booking Process Validations</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-0">The mobile app has various booking validations such as it should meet all the booking criteria such as the minimum number of guests, the property requires, the minimum number of stay days mentioned by the host, advance booking limits, reflecting the days the host has blocked for the booking and so on. It was surely tough and time-consuming for the app developers to validate these many scenarios in real-time, but they managed to do it anyway.</p>
