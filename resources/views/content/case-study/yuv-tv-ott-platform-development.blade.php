<p class="desc mb-0">Well, we all know there are not many options available that allow viewers to view live, events, web series, movies, radio, podcasts and various other audiovisual content on a single app and android TV-based OTT platform.<br><br>So, our aim for developing the mobile application and android TV-based OTT platform was to resolve all the issues that viewers tend to face about the audiovisual content while being on the journey using different frameworks and approaches. To begin with, we analyzed the concept hypothetically and created a file with the complete details covering all these points, diagrams, scenarios, problems, flow charts, and SRS for the entire workflow and planned the OTT platform based mobile application development process. After finalizing the document, In the third phase, based on the client's requirements and our findings, we defined OTT platform architectures for YUV TV OTT platform . After that, Our team of designers started working on the prepared OTT platform wire-frames and Application design. After getting approval on the final app design, our team of developers move ahead with the development phase. We created the prototype for the YUV Tv OTT platform with all the native data, After the client's review and confirmation of the prototype. The app developers started their development process by choosing the best-fit technology for android, iOS, and Android TV. We integrated APIs in the YUV Tv OTT platform and completed the whole app data flow. <br><br>We chose native technology swift for iOS development and Kotlin for android development and used JSON-based rest API development with Node and Express Framework. As the main purpose of the OTT platform application is to provide a smooth service experience to the users, our team of developers took the help of the Matic network to deliver an exceptional user experience.<br><br>From requirement gathering to deployment, the YUV Tv OTT platform development journey was full of challenges. However, our dedication and teamwork led us to deliver the solution successfully, as well as within the prescribed timeline & budget. After the development phase, our QA team tested the application before finally delivering it to the client.</p>

So, our developers created many custom views and created a UI that looks modern at the same time; it should be simple and easy to use including various sections such as a customized player for live streaming, VOD, podcast, and radio with each and every feature such as quality, subtitle, audio, episodes.</p>
