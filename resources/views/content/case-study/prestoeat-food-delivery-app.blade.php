<p class="desc mb-0">
Food delivery mobile application demands so much work as it has to work perfectly fine for users, restaurant owners and even for the delivery partners. The client wanted a simple and easy to use user interface that should not be troublesome even for a non-technical person who uses this mobile application to order the food or a delivery person who wants to earn their income through deliveries or restaurant owners of one of the oldest restaurants of the town who register themselves on the platform just not to loose in this competitive world.
<br><br>So, we aimed to develop a mobile application that can fulfill all the mentioned concerns of the client using different frameworks and approaches. To begin with, we analyzed the concept hypothetically and formed a file with the exclusive details covering all these points, diagrams, scenarios, problems, flow charts, and SRS for the entire workflow and planned the App development process. After finalizing the document, for the next phase, we moved on with Mobile App architectures for PrestoEat App based on the client's requirements. After that Our Mobile app designers started working on the prepared mobile app wire-frames and Application design. After getting approval on the final app design, our app developers started working on the development phase for the user side panel. Next, they started working on the restaurant panel and lastly, they focused on the delivery partner panel. We created the prototype for the PrestoEat app with all the native and data, After the client's review and confirmation of the prototype. The Mobile app developers started their development process by choosing the best-fit technology for android, iOS and the admin panel. We integrated API's in the PrestoEat app and completed the whole app data flow.
<br><br>We chose native technology swift for iOS development and Kotlin for android development and used JSON-based rest API development with Node and Laravel Framework. Hyperlink Infosystem developers used Angular 9 to create an admin panel for basic tasks such as managing rides, user details rating and reviews etc. We used web3 for calling the smart contracts with the help of solidity. Our app developers had used Magic SDK for passwordless authentication providing secure login. Any existing food-delivery mobile apps usually face the problem of poor user experience. Our app developers eliminated that with the help of a Matic network to deliver an exceptional user experience.
<br><br>From requirement gathering to deployment, the PrestoEat app development journey was full of challenges. However, our dedication and teamwork led us to deliver the solution successfully, as well as within the prescribed timeline & budget. After the development phase, our QA team tested the mobile application before finally delivering it to the client.
