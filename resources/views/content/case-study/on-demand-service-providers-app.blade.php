<p class="desc mb-0">Various service provider mobile applications allow users to connect with the service providers but EassyServe is unique in providing the users to connect with nearby service providers based on their current location.
<br><br>So, our aim for developing the mobile application was to provide an enhanced user experience providing them with a platform to connect with the service provider through their GPS navigation. To begin with, we analyzed the concept hypothetically and created a file with the complete details covering all these points, diagrams, scenarios, problems, flow charts, and SRS for the entire workflow and planned the App development process. After finalizing the document, In the third phase, based on the client's requirements and our findings, we defined Mobile App architectures for EassyServe Mobile App. After that, Our Mobile app designers started working on the prepared mobile app wire-frames and Application design. After getting approval on the final app design, our app developers move ahead with the development phase. We created the EassyServe app prototype with all the native data after the client's review and confirmation of the prototype. The Mobile app developers started their development process by choosing the best-fit technology for android, iOS, and the admin panel. Then, we integrated the API in the EassyServe mobile app and completed the whole app data flow.
<br><br>Hyperlink Infosystem app developers used the best fit native technology swift for iOS development and Kotlin for android development and used JSON-based rest API development with Laravel and Codeigniter Framework. We used web3 for calling the smart contracts with the help of solidity. Our app developers had used Magic SDK for passwordless authentication providing secure login. Any existing on demand service providing mobile apps is not providing an accurate nearby service provider listing. Our app developers eliminated that to deliver an exceptional flawless user experience.
<br><br>As the client wanted to develop a service-based e-commerce platform, the EassyServe app development journey was full of challenges, from requirement gathering to deployment. However, our dedication and teamwork led us to deliver the solution successfully, as well as within the prescribed timeline & budget. After the development phase, our QA team tested the mobile application before finally delivering it to the client.

<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>1. Location Detection</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-0">Developing an EassyServe mobile was a challenge itself because we needed to find the services on the basis of the current location with its proper Latitude and Longitude. We achieved that through deep analysis and created our own algorithm to crack that automatic location detection of the user. Our App Developers worked tirelessly to work on this functionality and developed a solution that can match the users' location with service providers' location to provide them with a list of service providers based on their service requirements.</p>
