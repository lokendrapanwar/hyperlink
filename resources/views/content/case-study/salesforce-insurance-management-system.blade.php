<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>1. Lead Management</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-4">The organization used to miss out on various lead opportunities due to the flaws of the legacy system. The Salesforce experts of Hyperlink InfoSystem integrated visual Flows that allow them to choose the data such as client's name, time zone, status, follow-up required, assigned team member and various other things from drop-down lists that have been culled from the most current information available.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>2. Inbound call Integration</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-4">The client wanted to integrate the inbound calls to their Salesforce that can help them keep the track of their calls so the team of Hyperlink InfoSystem created a custom package that can help them keep the track of their inbound calls and give them detailed analytical reports as well.</p>
<p class="desc mb-1 c-black"><b>3. Quote Creation</b></p>
<p class="desc mb-0">As every insurance amount differs from the other, the organization required a quote creation algorithm integrated into their Salesforce system. The team of Hyperlink InfoSystem helped them with the 28 parameter-based quote creation that can solve their complexity.</p>
