</li>
</ul>
<div class="page-section" id="title-11">
<h2 class="sub-title">Reasons Why Mobile Apps Fails</h2>
</div>
<p class="desc">If you are wondering if investing in the mobile application will take you to the top of the Google play store or Apple app store then you are in denial. You should understand the fact that numerous mobile applications not only fail to rank well on the app stores but also lose the entire customer base of the businesses. We are not stating this to boost your second thought but to warn you not to make silly mistakes that can be the reason for your mobile app idea failure. There are certain things that you should not do with your mobile application such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Inappropriate App Idea</h3>
<p class="desc mb-3">Most of the mobile applications, as we see them today, are reproductions of a couple of famous ones. The users already have an existing mobile app that offers the exact same services and fulfills the exact same user requirements. Users are searching for advancement and the inability to think of something imaginative causes disillusionment and loss of trust. You need to offer a new idea that will attract more users and tackle their issues. If you have a creative thought that is one of a kind, you are prepared to be viable.</p>
<p class="desc">The mobile application idea with the sole reason of bringing in cash can be the biggest blunder. Your principal motive ought to continuously/be tackling an issue that exists among the users. The advertisers play a fundamental part in this situation; their review consequences of the market will show the actual user requirements, which thus will be your model of application development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Unclear Familiarity With Target Audience</h3>
<p class="desc mb-3">Even if it sounds like a small step, not having a clear understanding of the target audience can be the down point of your mobile application. You can miss out on your actual user base if you have a vague understanding of the target audience. There are various things you have to keep in mind while figuring out your target audiences such as age, locality, characteristics of the audience and various others. You ought to contemplate making an application that offers easy-to-use mobile app features for each age group. </p>
<p class="desc">The user ought to feel associated with your application. If you can not focus on your primary target audience suitably, it will without a doubt portray your thoughts insufficiently; your application won't ever reach the right people, hence the entire app development idea can backfire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Fail to Consider Different Mobile App Platform</h3>
<p class="desc">If you think there are just two platforms that exist; iOS and android then your mobile app idea will surely fail. Even though you think you are fine with targeting one of these platforms, you should seriously consider the alternate platform and should have strong reasons to ignore one of these platforms. The count of global android users is high but the popularity of the iOS operating system is insane. Along with all these, various app users out there prefer to have a web application for their windows or mac system.</p>
</li>
 <li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Mobile App Features</h3>
<p class="desc">Mobile app features are one of the ways to win over the hearts of app users. But it can be a turnaround if you fail to offer a significant number of features. Your mobile app should offer all and only necessary features; offering too many or even fewer features can bore the app users and will increase the abandonment rate of the mobile application. While assuming you have been too specific about adding features in your application, it could likewise make an unfriendly difference, that of making your application deficient. The number of mobile app features ought to be chosen after appropriately examining the ease of use of your application alongside the devices in which it will be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Ignorance of User Experience</h3>

Truly we live in a fast world, where no one has the time and patience to pause for a moment or two and figure out how to use your application, particularly when the world is full of other easy-to-use options accessible around them. </p>
<p class="desc">What's more, on the off chance that you anticipate that they should invest such a lot of energy, you are positively putting resources into a fruitless mobile application. For an application to be viable with the users you really want to break down the target audience based on a clear understanding and their consistency with evolving with the trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Fail To Keep The Essence of App Idea</h3>
<p class="desc">Will you choose a mobile application that allows the users to communicate through texts only; no emojis, no media sharing nothing else? No, right? That's what you can call the essence of the mobile app. Even though you are focusing on the functionalities of the mobile application, there has to be some features and functionalities that you should have in your mobile application. They help to enhance the interaction of the users with your mobile application. If you have an application that gives no method of communication or feedback to the client, they will unquestionably be less keen on using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Underestimating The Importance of Backend Support</h3>
<p class="desc">It particularly applies to the applications intended for the eCommerce market or in any event, gaming applications. For your application to be steady, you will require hearty backend support. With cloud innovation available to you, the time has come to embrace quicker and better methods for support and storage.

<li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Eliminating The App Marketing Process</h3>
<p class="desc mb-3">This is the most common mistake that app owners usually make - promoting your application after it has been made and sent off. A little promotion never hurts any application. You can genuinely take advantage of social media and even request that your possibilities share reactions and thoughts regarding what they might want to have for the application.</p>
<p class="desc">Develop a little bit of excitement about the app launch before the actual launch of the mobile application. It will support making a prepared market for your application, so you won't have to work later to make it noticeable to your main interest group. The mobile app launch event is likewise really smart assuming you make sure your target audience is already discussing your application. However, at that point, ensure that your application offers the features and functionalities that you have created hype about.</p>

Mobile app performance is a systemic methodology and should be optimized rather than blowing up the entire mobile application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 class="sub-title-2">Ignoring The Users&rsquo; Feedback</h3>
<p class="desc">Your mobile application exists because of your users and there is no other explanation for that. Neglecting to perceive their thought process about your application can convert into app failure.
